orbslam3_ros
============

This package is meant as a support package to [ORB_SLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3) and provides (1) a simple ROS wrapper example, and (2) a method of exposing ORB_SLAM3 as a library to ROS packages.

## Getting Started

Place [ORB_SLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3) and this package into your `catkin_ws`. Build `ORB_SLAM3` as usual (i.e., their `./build.sh` script). Then, `catkin build` will work as expected, building the `orbslam3_ros` package.
